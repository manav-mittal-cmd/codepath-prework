### Idea for App to Build: Gym Fitness Tracker
The app would allow users to create workout plans and log their progress. It will integrate some of my favorite apps like Clock and Spotify. The idea is for gym goers to be able to control everthing from one app. This app would provide users with a more personalized experience in selecting music and tailoring their playlists depending on the workout plan. The seemless clock design would also be a good addition, allowing users to track rest and set times. This app has a lot of potential to scale by adding analytics and suggestions based on user progress. 


## Notes

The app is very simple to build. The only challenge was getting familiar with the Xcode user interface. Updating software and downloading tools can take some time.
